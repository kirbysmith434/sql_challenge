## SQL_Challenge

## Description
In this challenge, I was asked to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I was asked to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data.

To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, pgAdmin 4, and GitHub.

## Table of Contents
Code for analysis found in the 'data' file within the 'Starter_Code_2' directory. Data for analysis was pulled from the 'departments.csv', 'dept_managers.csv', 'employees.csv', 'salaries.csv', 'titles.csv', and 'dept_emp.csv' files within the 'Starter_Code_2' directory.

## Installation Instructions
Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files within the 'EmployeeSQL' directory on my github "sql_challenge" repo.

## Usage
Can Git Clone all files from my 'sql_challenge' repo.

## Credits
For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.
